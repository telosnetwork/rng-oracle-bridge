# RNG Oracle Bridge

This repository contains the Telos RNG Oracle EVM <> Antelope Bridge.

The bridge requires the deployment of 3 components to work: the [EVM](https://github.com/telosnetwork/native-oracle-bridge/tree/main/evm) & [Antelope](https://github.com/telosnetwork/native-oracle-bridge/tree/main/antelope) components which are part of this repository and the Listener component that is part of our [Telos Oracle Scripts](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-oracle-scripts) repository. Follow the instructions below to deploy it.

## REQUIREMENTS

This repository requires NodeJS 14+, NPM and the cleos command line tool.

## INSTALL

Clone the repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge`

## EVM

### RNGOracleBridge

The bridge contract, currently deployed at

**TESTNET :** TBD

**MAINNET :** TBD

### RNGOracleConsumer

An example implementation of a consumer with request & callback

### GasOracleBridge

The gas bridge to query current gas price. Only for test purposes, this contract will not be deployed.

For more, refer to the documentation inside the [`evm`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/tree/main/evm) folder

## ANTELOPE

### rng.bridge.cpp

For more, refer to the documentation inside the [`antelope`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/tree/main/antelope) folder

## LISTENERS

The listener for this bridge is located inside our [Telos Oracle Scripts](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-oracle-scripts) repository

Refer to the `config.yml.testnet.sample` file's **listeners > rng > bridge** section for an example.

Optionally, if you have been registered for it, you can look for the **listeners > rng > request** section to enable the RNG Request Listener that will sign incoming RNG Oracle requests on Antelope.

## MAKE A REQUEST !

Deploy a contract that calls the newly deployed `RNGOracleBridge` contract's `request(uint callId, uint64 seed, uint min, uint max, uint callback_gas, address callback_address) external payable` function, passing a value to cover fee and callback gas cost (see below). On the same contract, or in a new one, implement a `receiveRandom(uint callId, uint random) external` callback function in order to receive the oracle's answer. 

You can refer to the [`RNGOracleConsumer`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/blob/main/evm/contracts/RNGOracleConsumer.sol) EVM contract for an example.

### What is callback gas ? How do I know what value to pass ?

The `callback_gas` variable contains the gas units you estimate will be needed to call your `receiveRandom()` callback function in your own smart contract (ie: 50000). This is the maximum amount of gas that will be spent by the bridge when calling your contract, if your callback implementation asks for more gas, the transaction will fail and the request will be deleted from the bridge's storage.

You can query the TLOS value to pass in your `request()` function call by calling the `calculateRequestPrice(uint callback_gas)` public function. 

You can alternatively calculate that price by taking the gas price from the `GasOracleBridge` with `getPrice()`, multiply that price with your estimate gas units (ie: 50000) and add the fee from the `RNGOracleBridge` that you can query with `fee()`:

`Price = Gas Units * Gas Price + Bridge Fee`

# RNG Oracle Bridge

This repository includes three folders that need to be setup for the bridge to work: [EVM](https://github.com/telosnetwork/native-oracle-bridge/tree/main/evm), [Antelope](https://github.com/telosnetwork/native-oracle-bridge/tree/main/antelope), [listeners](https://github.com/telosnetwork/native-oracle-bridge/tree/main/listeners).

Follow the instructions below, in the right order, to deploy it

## REQUIREMENTS

This repository requires NodeJS 14+, NPM and pm2 installed as well as the cleos command line tool.

## INSTALL

Clone the repo with:

`git clone https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge`

## EVM

### RNGOracleBridge

The bridge contract

### RNGOracleConsumer

An example implementation of a consumer with request & callback

### GasOracleBridge

The gas bridge to query current gas price. Only for test purposes, this contract will not be deployed.

For more, refer to the documentation inside the [`evm`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/tree/main/evm) folder

## ANTELOPE

### rng.bridge.cpp

For more, refer to the documentation inside the [`antelope`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/tree/main/antelope) folder

## LISTENERS 

The listener for this bridge is located inside our [Telos Oracle Scripts](https://github.com/telosnetwork/telos-oracle-scripts) repository

Refer to the configuration sample's **listeners > rng > bridge** section for an example.

## MAKE A REQUEST !

Deploy a contract that calls the newly deployed `RNGOracleBridge` contract's `request(uint callId, uint64 seed, uint min, uint max, uint callback_gas, address callback_address)` function, passing a value to cover fee and callback gas cost (see below). On the same contract, or in a new one, implement a `receiveRandom(uint callId, uint random)` callback function in order to receive the oracle's answer. 

You can refer to the [`RNGOracleConsumer`](https://github.com/telosnetwork/rng-oracle-bridge/blob/main/evm/contracts/RNGOracleConsumer.sol) EVM contract for an example.

### What is callback gas ? How do I know what value to pass ?

The `callback_gas` variable contains the gas units you estimate will be needed to call your `receiveRandom()` callback function in your own smart contract (ie: 50000). This is the maximum amount of gas that will be spent by the bridge when calling your contract, if your callback implementation asks for more gas, the transaction will fail and the request will be deleted from storage.

You can query the TLOS value to pass in your `request()` function call by calling the `getCost(uint callback_gas)` function. 

You can also calculate that cost by taking the gas price from the `GasOracleBridge` with `getPrice()`, multiply that price with your estimate gas units (ie: 50000) and add the fee from the `RNGOracleBridge` that you can query with `fee()`:

`Cost = Gas Units * Gas Price + Bridge Fee`
